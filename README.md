ReverseCoder AI – Final Demo Script (with future scope)

“Hello everyone, I’m Pavan,
and today I’m presenting ReverseCoder AI, an intelligent system that automatically decodes and categorises financial transaction strings.

🌍 Problem Background

In today’s digital world, almost everyone uses online payments.
Whenever someone sends or receives money, banks generate complex merchant strings like:

CCD AP 11:58 TXN#001 ₹892

These strings contain hidden details like merchant type, location, time, and amount — but they are all fused into one unstructured line.

Most banking systems depend on third-party decoding APIs, which leads to:

High recurring costs

Dependency on external vendors

Limited customisation

Slow or inconsistent classification



---

🚀 Our Solution – ReverseCoder AI

To solve this, I built ReverseCoder AI, a fully in-house system that categorises transactions autonomously, without any external API.

The system works in two modes:

1️⃣ Manual mode – User types a transaction string
2️⃣ Automatic mode – User uploads a CSV file

ReverseCoder AI then extracts and predicts:

Category (Tea/Coffee, Fuel, Restaurant, etc.)

Location (AP, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, etc.)

Amount

Confidence Score

🧠 Technical Explanation

ReverseCoder AI uses a rule-based AI engine designed from scratch.

🔹 1. Text Preprocessing

Normalises each transaction string: lowercasing, noise removal, pattern matching.

🔹 2. Category Classification

Keyword-based scoring identifies the best-matching category.

🔹 3. Location Detection

Shortcodes like "AP", "HYD", "KRL" map to Indian states.

🔹 4. Amount Extraction

A regex engine detects amounts even if hidden or formatted differently.

🔹 5. Analytics Dashboard

Users get instant insights through:

Bar charts

Location graphs

Spending totals

Summary boxes


Built entirely with:

Python + Streamlit

HTML + CSS Web UI

📊 Why ReverseCoder AI?

By eliminating third-party APIs, businesses can:

Reduce operational costs

Improve privacy

Gain full control

Increase reliability



---

🔮 Future Scope

This is just a demo to present my idea.
In the future, I plan to:

Integrate more advanced ML/NLP models

Add deep-learning based merchant understanding

Apply noise-robust transformers

Implement user feedback loops

Add advanced security, encryption & API-level protection

Upgrade the analytics engine for real-time insights


ReverseCoder AI will continue to evolve into a more powerful, enterprise-grade financial intelligence system.

🎯 Conclusion

ReverseCoder AI converts unstructured merchant strings into meaningful financial insights — instantly, accurately, and securely.

Thank you.”
